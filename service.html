Through Aggie Men's Club, I devoted 6 hours a week to learn a group dance in order to earn money for Kairos Christian School. Unfortunately, our group did not place at the event, but we still raised nearly $10000.  </p>

                        <p>In my semesters at South Plains College, I grew close to the Baptist student ministry. I joined the Student Leadership team in Fall 2018 to provide for the community by servicing 50 cent lunches, hosting student worship nights, and setting up and striking events planned by the Baptist Student Ministry. In addition, I helped spread the gospel to students and furthered my relationship with God. </p>
