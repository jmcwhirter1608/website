                            I applied online through this link and was chosen to participate in the summer long online interactive course and weekend experience at Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio. This experience allowed me to learn about teamwork, leadership, fast-paced environments, and project presentation. Four teams, including my own, competed to create a rover that completed certain tasks on a physical track. Some of these tasks were simple like identifying materials using a color sensor while others were more difficult like collecting a sample through difficult terrain. Additionally, our team marketed and presented this rover in hopes of landing a Mars contract with NASA. This was a valuable experience. </p>
