                        <p>
                        I am proficient in C++, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, and Verilog coding languages. Currently, I am pursuing better understand of Java and React tools. I have experience with Linux systems and terminal commands through college assignments including practice using git. I have a knowledge of Machine Learning and Electronics through coursework, but I have yet to apply this knowledge. I am certifed in Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Wildernes First Aid with experience from Camp Timberline. I have experience communicating through High School One Act Play, campus tours, and presentation.

                        <h3>Applications Engineering </h3>
                        <p> In all forms, I enjoy finding new ways to use new technology to improve processes that may seem unrelated. For example, Drones have been a very useful product for the photography and videography industries. But, did you know that it has also been useful for agriculture? During past summers, I have learned to use a DJI Phantom 4 Pro to map crop circles using Climate FieldView and DroneDeploy software. With this additive information, we are better capable to maintain crops and predict yield. </p>

                        <h3> 3D Printing </h3>
                        <p> One Christmas, I got a Creality CR-10 3D printer and Simplify3D software. In the following months, I learned how to print figures I found online like a flexible filament extruder and a model of Groot from Guardians of the Galaxy. While in college, I learned to use AutoCAD and Fusion360 software expanding my knowledge of 3D printing software and allowing me to create my own prints. Although the printing material is cheap and fragile, it has allowed me to quickly prototype ideas and determine marketability.
