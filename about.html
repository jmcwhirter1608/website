                        <p>Howdy, my name is John Brea McWhirter and I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering. My family raised me in Plains, TX. As a descendant in a long line of farmers, I was taught an invaluable work ethic maintaining crops every summer. This foundation led me to achieve high grades throughout High School and College and succeed in extracurricular activites. In High School, I participated in Football and Basketball as a Team Captain, took supplemental courses to achieve a 30 on my ACT, and devoted time to UIL Calculator, eventually qualifying to state. I also built proper public speaking skills by joining UIL One Act Play and, as the lead role, successfully guided our show to state my senior year.</div>

                        <p>I continued my success at South Plains College for three semesters. Here, I became a math tutor, campus ambassador, and Baptist Student Ministry Leader. I tutored students in courses ranging from Intermediate Math to Calculus II. As a campus ambassador, I represented my college on a professional level by giving tours, hosting events, and providing drone footage for commercials. In addition, I was awarded an opportunity to visit the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Glenn Research Center as part of the National Community College Aerospace Scholars program which encouraged my degree choice. To learn more about this experience, navigate to my portfolio page. In Spring 2020, I transferred to Blinn College for courses unavailable at South Plains College that could transfer to Texas A&M University. Despite the pandemic, I transferred to Texas A&M University.</p>

                        <p> With the pandemic still rampaging, I focused on completing the many labs unavailable to me at my previous colleges. In the summer of 2021, I stepped away from school and technology and was hired as a Ropes Counselor for Camp Timberline in Estes Park, Colorado. I spread the gospel to children, ensured a safe camping environment, and used my farming experience to help maintain the grounds. </p>

                        <p>Recently, I have joined a men's organization called Aggie Men's Club in order to learn more about my diverse community at Texas A&M University. Although a difficult semester academically, I worked vigorously and maintained a 3.7 GPA. My goal this semester is to maintain my GPA, earn an internship for the summer, and be more socially active at Texas A&M University. I am constantly seeking more leadership roles and responsibility in order to improve my fellow Aggies and reputation.</p>
